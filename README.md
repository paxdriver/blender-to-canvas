PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Using model data from Blender to render 3D it in canvas

PLATFORM: 'Linux-5.19.0-50-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.35'

BLENDER VERSION 3.0.1
PYTHON INTERACTIVE CONSOLE 3.10.12 [GCC 11.4.0]
  or
BLENDER VERSION 2.8
PYTHON INTERACTIVE CONSOLE 3.9

The version of python used depends entirely on the compatibility of the version of Blender that you're using. If you're trying to work with an appImage of Blender instead of an installed one, then you may find that only certain directories on your machine will work for saving json data to file. The paths will also be skewed if you're using appImage, and permissions can be a bit of a hassle too. If the python script isn't working for you then I suspect the version and type of launcher used for the Blender program is the culprit.
